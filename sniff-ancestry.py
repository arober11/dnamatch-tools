# The output of "save page as..." from AncestryDNA match list.  Note: if your
# web browser gives you multiple options for saving the page, use the one that
# produces a complete .html file. It should be a pretty big file. If that
# doesn't work, try the other options until you find one that works.

# The file location must match where you stored the file.
# WINDOWS: you may need a line similar to one of these (without the hash):
#htmlfile = 'C:/Users/Treece/Desktop/A.html'
#htmlfile = 'A.html'
# OTHERS: you may need a line similar to this (without the hash):
#htmlfile = '/tmp/A.html'
htmlfile = '/tmp/A.html'

# The output file name
tester_csv = 'matches.csv'

# Also save "cross matches" - if it's an in-common-with report?  NB: it's not
# possible to save amount of shared cM this way. E.g. if you're logged into kit
# "A", showing matches in common with "B" and you save_crossmatches, there will
# be an entry in the spreadsheet showing that "B" matches "C" but without any
# amount for shared cM. They may not share any DNA in reality. If seeing this
# list seems useful to you, try setting it to True.
# This is experimental and may not work if set to True.
